## What is this?

@gertalot/sliders is a small React library with a number of custom hooks that make it easy to build sliders, dials, and
other components that respond to dragging and sliding actions from the user. The hooks take care of all user
interaction, such as dragging, rotating, using the mouse wheel, or two-finger scrolling.

## Demo

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Slider">
    Drag the slider, or use the mouse wheel. This component is created with a simple SVG, and uses the `useSlider`
    custom hook. The code for this component is on the [`useSlider` documentation](/sliders/reference/useslider).
    <VolumeSlider client:idle />
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dial">
    Turn the dial to go up to eleven! Or use the mousewheel, or drag vertically. This component is an SVG and uses the
    `useDial` custom hook to handle all user interaction and returns an angle and a value to the component. The code for
    this component is on the [`useDial` documentation](/sliders/reference/usedial).
    <VolumeDial client:idle />
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why does it exist?

For a project involving a climate-controlled environment, I needed something to control temperature and humidity,
preferrably from my phone. This was an excellent excuse to put together this library.
Moving the code that handles the user's dragging, rotating, and scrolling actions out of my components and into
reusable hooks seemed sensible, and I am sharing this in the hope it might be useful or educational for others.

## Example

Here's a minimal example of one of the custom hooks, `useWheelToAdjust`. These hooks take care of all user interaction
and return properties you can use in your components. In this example, the hook returns a `wheelDelta` value
representing the speed at which the user is rotating the mouse wheel.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Demo">
    <UseWheelToAdjustComponent client:load />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    <Code code={UseWheelToAdjustComponentCode} lang="tsx" title="UseWheelToAdjust.tsx" mark={8} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
