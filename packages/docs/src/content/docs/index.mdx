## Demo

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Slider" icon="star">
    Drag the slider, or use the mouse wheel. This component is created with
    a simple SVG, and uses the `useSlider` custom hook.
    <VolumeSlider client:idle />
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dial" icon="star">
    Turn the dial to go up to eleven! Or use the mousewheel, or drag vertically.
    This component is an SVG and uses the `useDial` custom hook to handle all
    user interaction and returns an angle and a value to the component.
    <VolumeDial client:idle />
  </Card>

</CardGrid>
