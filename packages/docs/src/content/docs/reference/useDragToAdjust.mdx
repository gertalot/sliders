import UseDragToAdjustComponentCode from "../../../components/UseDragToAdjustComponent.tsx?raw";

A custom React hook that registers "dragging" actions from the user that start on the element
referenced by `dragAreaRef`. This hook responds to touch and mouse events, and will return a
value corresponding to the distance of the dragging motion in the `dragAdjust` property.

This hook can be configured to register horizontal or vertical dragging motions, and for touch
events, the number of touches required to start dragging can be configured.

This custom hooks allows for creating UI elements that can be adjusted by dragging, such as
sliders, or values that change in response to user input.

This is a lower-level custom hook that is used by [`useDial`](/sliders/reference/usedial).

## Example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Demo">
    <UseDragToAdjustComponent client:load />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    <Code code={UseDragToAdjustComponentCode} lang="tsx" title="UseDragToAdjust.tsx" mark={8} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

```tsx
const {
  dragAdjust, // a value indicating how much the user is dragging
  isDragAdjusting, // true if the user is dragging
} = useDragtoAdjust({
  dragAreaRef, // "active" element that listens to dragging actions
  sensitivity, // larger values = slower changes in output. Default is 100
  measureVerticalDragging, // true if the hook measures vertical pointer distance, false if horizontal
  dragTouches, // the number of touches on touch devices that count as dragging
});
```

## Props

### `dragAreaRef`

(required) A `RefObject` referencing a DOM element that functions as the
"active" area. Any dragging or sliding action that happens when the pointer is over this
element is registered as dragging the target.

### `sensitivity`

Determines quickly the resulting value changes in response to the user dragging
Higher sensitivity values result in smaller adjustments for the same dragging distance.
Default value is 100.

### `measureVerticalDragging`

Determines if this hook responds to horizontal or vertical dragging actions.
Default is true.

### `dragTouches`

For touch devices, specifies the number of touches that will register as dragging.
Defaults to 2.

## Returns

### `dragAdjust`

A value corresponding to the current drag distance.

### `isDragAdjusting`

True if the user is currently dragging.
