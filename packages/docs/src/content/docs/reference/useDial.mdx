A custom react hook that registers dragging and mouse wheel actions and returns an angle representing
a rotation of the target element relative to the origin.

This custom hook allows for creating UI elements such as knobs and dials that can be adjusted by dragging
or using the mouse wheel.

This hook registers dragging actions from the user of the `targetRef` element, and also handles adjusting
the dial through rotating the mouse wheel or dragging vertically when the pointer is over the `dragAreaRef` element.

The hook will use the position of the pointer while dragging to calculate an angle relative to an origin
(which is the center of rotation).

## Props

This hook accepts a few different combinations of props (the valid combinations are described in types
so if your editor is set up to autocomplete based on type it will help you).

### Basic props for "infinite" rotation

In its most basic form, this hook allows for infitie rotations clockwise or counterclockwise, and will
return just the angle (in radians from 0-2π, where 0 is "3 o'clock"), and the total angle (in radians,
but taking into account the number of full rotations). The props are:

- `dragAreaRef` - (required) the element that is "active", i.e. the hook's event listeners will register
  mouse wheel rotation and vertical dragging actions when the pointer is over this element.
- `targetRef` - (required) the target element that can be dragged around an origin
- `origin` - This optional prop should, when specified, be either a point or a function. When
  specified as a point of type `Point2D`, they are the `{x,y}` coordinates of the center of
  rotation, \_relative to the `dragAreaRef` element's bounding rect.
  When a function is passed, the function will be called when the `dragAreaRef` changes size,
  and can be used to dynamically change the center of rotation.
  If `origin` is not specified, it will be dynamically set to the center of the `dragAreaRef`
  element.

### Limit the possible angles

The second form takes the basic props described above, and allows the following in addition:

- `minAngle` and `maxAngle` - specifies the minimum and maximum allowed angles of rotation.
  If the user tries to drag past these angles, the angle will be clamped to
  the minimum or maximum angle.
- `angle` - optionally specify the initial angle that the hook should use. If not specified,
  uses `minAngle`. Note: if no angles are specified at all, the initial angle will be 0.

### Map rotation to values

The most complete set of props linearly map an angle of rotation to a value, and this is probably
the most likely way you'll use this hook. The "volume knob" example below uses these props, to
limit the possible angles to betwee "7 o'clock" and "5 o'clock" (going clockwise), and map the
angle to a value between 0-11. You specify the following:

- `minAngle` and `maxAngle` as above;
- `minValue` and `maxValue` - the minimum and maximum values. These correspond to the minimum
  and maximum angles.
- `value` - an optional initial value, which will be mapped to the corresponding angle. If not
  specified, the minimum value will be used.

## Returns

This custom hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `isRotating` - `true` if the user is actively rotating the dial, either through dragging the
  target, using the mouse wheel, or dragging vertically on the `dragAreaRef` element.
- `isOnTarget` - `true` if the pointer is currently over the `targetRef` element.
- `angle` - the angle of rotation, between 0-2π, where 0 is "3 o'clock" and values increase
  clockwise. This can be used to position the target element, transform elements, or otherwise
  indicate the angle of rotation visually.
- `fullRotations` - the number of full, 360° rotations the user has made. This starts at 0,
  and clockwise rotations will be positive, anti-clockwise is negative.
- `totalAngle` - this is the total angle, taking full rotations into account.
- `value` - the mapped value, if `minValue`, `maxValue`, `minAngle`, and `maxAngle` were specified
  in the props.

## Example

This is all much easier to show than to describe, so here is a full example that models a volume
dial that goes from 0-11. The user can change the volume by rotating the knob, using the mouse wheel,
or dragging vertically in the component's area.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Demo">
    <VolumeDial client:load />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="VolumeDial component">
    <Code code={VolumeDialCode} lang="tsx" title="VolumeDial.tsx" mark={{ range: "24-29" }} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="VolumeDialTicks component">
    <Code code={VolumeDialTicksCode} lang="tsx" title="VolumeDialTicks.tsx" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
