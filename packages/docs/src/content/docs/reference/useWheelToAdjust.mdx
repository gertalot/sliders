import UseWheelToAdjustComponent from "../../../components/UseWheelToAdjustComponent";
import UseWheelToAdjustComponentCode from "../../../components/UseWheelToAdjustComponent.tsx?raw";

A custom React hook that registers mouse wheel rotation from the user that start on the element
referenced by `dragAreaRef`. This hook detects how fast the user is rotating the mouse wheel and
returns a value corresponding to the speed of the mouse wheel.

This custom hooks allows for creating UI elements that can be adjusted by using the mouse wheel,
such as sliders, or values that change in response to user input.

This is a lower-level custom hook that is used by [`useSlider`](/sliders/reference/useslider)
and [`useDial`](/sliders/reference/usedial).

## Example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Demo">
    <UseWheelToAdjustComponent client:load />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    <Code code={UseWheelToAdjustComponentCode} lang="tsx" title="UseWheelToAdjust.tsx" mark={8} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

```tsx
const {
  dragAdjust, // a value indicating how much the user is dragging
  isDragAdjusting, // true if the user is dragging
} = useDragtoAdjust({
  dragAreaRef, // "active" element that listens to dragging actions
  sensitivity, // larger values = slower changes in output. Default is 100
  measureVerticalDragging, // true if the hook measures vertical pointer distance, false if horizontal
  dragTouches, // the number of touches on touch devices that count as dragging
});
```

## Props

### `dragAreaRef`

(required) A `RefObject` referencing a DOM element that functions as the
"active" area. Any dragging or sliding action that happens when the pointer is over this
element is registered as dragging the target.

### `sensitivity`

Determines quickly the resulting value changes in response to the user dragging
Higher sensitivity values result in smaller adjustments for the same dragging distance.
Default value is 100.

### `measureVerticalDragging`

Determines if this hook responds to horizontal or vertical dragging actions.
Default is true.

### `dragTouches`

For touch devices, specifies the number of touches that will register as dragging.
Defaults to 2.

## Returns

### `dragAdjust`

A value corresponding to the current drag distance.

### `isDragAdjusting`

True if the user is currently dragging.
