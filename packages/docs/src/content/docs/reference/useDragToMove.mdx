import UseDragToMoveComponent from "../../../components/UseDragToMoveComponent";
import UseDragToMoveComponentCode from "../../../components/UseDragToMoveComponent.tsx?raw";

A custom React hook that registers "dragging" actions from the user that occur on the target element
referenced by `targetRef`. This hook responds to touch and mouse events, and will return the position
of the pointer relative to the `dragAreaRef` element, where top-left is `{x:0, y:0}`.

This hook can be configured to only respond to dragging actions that started on the target element, or
to respond to dragging actions anywhere on the `dragAreaRef` element. In the latter scenario, the `position`
that is returned represents the position of the pointer relative to the `dragArearef` element. This can
be used, for example, to immediately move the target to the position indicated by the location where
the mouse was clicked or the screen was touched.

This custom hooks allows for creating UI elements that can be adjusted by dragging, such as
sliders, or values that change in response to user input. It handles all event listeners and logic to
detect dragging actions, and forms the basis for the other custom hooks in this library.

Note that the `dragAreaRef` and `targetRef` elements don't necessarily have to be the target of the pointer
events, or be in the composed path of the event. As long as the relevant events occur within the bounds
of these elements, dragging actions will be registered.

## Example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Demo">
    <UseDragToMoveComponent client:load />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    <Code code={UseDragToMoveComponentCode} lang="tsx" title="UseDragToMove.tsx" mark={{ range: "8-12" }} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

```tsx
const {
  isOnTarget, // true if the pointer is over the target
  isOnDragArea, // true if the pointer is over the dragAreaRef element
  isDragging, // true if the user is actively dragging the target
  isStartDragOnTarget, // true if the dragging action started on the target
  position, // the position as `{x,y}` coordinates relative to the dragAreaRef client rect
} = useDragToMove({
  dragAreaRef, // the "active" element that registers dragging actions
  targetRef, // the target element that can be dragged around
  shouldStartDragOnTarget, // if true, dragging must start on the target element
});
```

### Props

#### `dragAreaRef`

(required) A `RefObject` referencing a DOM element that functions as the
"active" area. Any dragging or sliding action that happens when the pointer is over this
element is registered as dragging the target.

#### `targetRef`

(required) A `RefObject` referencing a DOM element in your component.
This is the "target" element of your slider, i.e. the thing you slide.

#### `shouldStartDragOnTarget`

If `true`, only register dragging actions that started on the target element. Defaults to true.
If this value it true, clicking and dragging anywhere on the `dragAreaRef` element will immediately
update the position. If set to `false`, the hook will only register a dragging action (and update
the position) if the action started with the pointer over the target element.

### Returns

#### `isOnTarget`

True if the pointer is hovering or dragging over the target element.

#### `isOnDragArea`

True if the pointer is over the element references by `dragAreaRef`.

#### `isDragging`

True if the user is actively dragging the target element.

#### `isStartDragOnTarget`

True if the user started dragging with the pointer over the target.

#### `position`

The most recent `{x, y}` position of the pointer during a dragging action, relative to the `dragAreaRef`
element's client rect.
