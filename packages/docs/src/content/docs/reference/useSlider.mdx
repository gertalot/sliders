# `useSlider`

A custom React hook that registers horizontal or vertical dragging actions from the user that start on the element
referenced by `dragAreaRef`. This hook responds to touch and mouse events, and will return a value between `minValue`
and `maxValue` corresponding to the distance of the dragging action relative to the drag area.

This hook responds to the user dragging the target, clicking or touching along the drag area, or using the mouse
wheel.

This hook can be configured to return a value between `minValue` and `maxValue` inclusive (defaults to 0-1), and the
sensitivity of the mouse wheel can be configured as well. Finally, the hook can be configured to respond to horizontal
or vertical dragging motions.

## Usage

```ts
const { value, isAdjusting, isOnTarget, isOnDragArea } = useSlider({
  targetRef,
  dragAreaRef,
  minValue = 0,
  maxValue = 1,
  initialValue = 0,
  sensitivity = 100,
  isVertical = true,
});
```
