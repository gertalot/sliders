import { Card, CardGrid, Tabs, TabItem, Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import VolumeSlider from "../../../components/VolumeSlider";
import VolumeSliderCode from "../../../components/VolumeSlider.tsx?raw";
import Speaker from "../../../components/Speaker";
import SpeakerCode from "../../../components/Speaker.tsx?raw";

A custom React hook that registers horizontal or vertical dragging actions from the user that start on the element
referenced by `dragAreaRef`. This hook responds to touch and mouse events, and will return a value between `minValue`
and `maxValue` corresponding to the distance of the dragging action relative to the drag area.

This hook responds to the user dragging the target, clicking or touching along the drag area, or using the mouse
wheel.

This hook can be configured to return a value between `minValue` and `maxValue` inclusive (defaults to 0-1), and the
sensitivity of the mouse wheel can be configured as well. Finally, the hook can be configured to respond to horizontal
or vertical dragging motions.

## Example: A Volume Slider

The example below shows a volume slider that uses the `useSlider` hook.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Demo">
    <VolumeSlider client:load />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="VolumeSlider Component">
    <Code code={VolumeSliderCode} lang="tsx" title="VolumeSlider.tsx" mark={{ range: "15-22" }} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Speaker Component">
    <Code code={SpeakerCode} lang="tsx" title="Speaker.tsx" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

```ts
const { value, isAdjusting, isOnTarget, isOnDragArea } = useSlider({
  targetRef,
  dragAreaRef,
  minValue = 0,
  maxValue = 1,
  initialValue = 0,
  sensitivity = 100,
  isVertical = true,
});
```

## Props

The following props can be passed to the custom hook:

### `targetRef`

(required) A `RefObject` referencing a DOM element in your component.
This is the "target" element of your slider, i.e. the thing you slide.

### `dragAreaRef`

(required) A `RefObject` referencing a DOM element that functions as the
"active" area. Any dragging or sliding action that happens when the pointer is over this
element is registered as dragging the target.

### `minValue`

a `number` representing the minimum possible value. If the user keeps dragging
beyond the minimum value, the hook's `value` will stay at `minValue`. Default is 0.

### `maxValue`

a `number` representing the maximum possible value. If the user keeps dragging
beyond the maximum value, the hook's `value` will stay at `maxValue`. Default is 1.

### `initialValue`

a `number` that is used as the initial value when rendering the component.
Defaults to 0.

### `sensitivity`

a `number` that is a measure of how much rotating the mouse wheel will
change the slider. Larger numbers mean slower changes. This uses [`useWheelToAdjust`](/sliders/reference/usewheeltoadjust)
under the hood.

### `isVertical`

`true` if the custom hook should register vertical dragging motion, `false`
for horizontal dragging motion. Defaults to `true`.

### Returns

The `useSlider` hook returns an object with the following properties:

### `value`

A value between `minValue` and `maxValue` that represents the current value of
the slider object. Use this to set the position of the target element or otherwise indicate
the value.

### `isAdjusting`

`true` if the user is actively dragging or using the wheel. This can be used
to conditionally render the component in a particular way.

### `isOnTarget`

`true` if the pointer is currently over the target element referenced by `targetAreaRef`.

### `isOnDragArea`

`true` if the pointer is currently over the element referenced by `dragAreaRef`.
Note that this actually checks if the pointer coordinates are within the bounding rect of the
dragArea elements; it doesn't use the pointer event target or composed path, in case the element
is obscured by another element.
