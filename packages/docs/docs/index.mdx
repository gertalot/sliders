# Slider Hooks

React (headless) components with custom hooks to build all kinds of sliders, knobs, and dials.

## What is this?

This package provides a number of [React Custom Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)
that make it easy to build React components such as sliders and dials.

### Demo

<UseWheelToAdjustDemo />

## live demo

```jsx live
function Clock(props) {
  const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date());

  useEffect(() => {
    const timerID = setInterval(() => tick(), 1000);
    return function cleanup() {
      clearInterval(timerID);
    };
  });

  function tick() {
    setDate(new Date());
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>It's {date.toLocaleTimeString()}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## When should I use this?

This package is useful if you want to create React components that respond to the user dragging or scrolling,
such as sliders (e.g. a volume slider), or dials (e.g. a thermostat).
